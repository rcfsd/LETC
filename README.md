# LargeEventTimeCorpus


### Overview

TimeBank-EventTime  (TBET) is a new temporal information corpus based on TimeBank-Dense (36 docs, a subset of TB). Instead of using the pair-wise  Temporal Link (TLINK) annotation schema to model a relation between two mentions (i.e. event, time expression and document creation time), TBET annotates the occurring time of each individual event.

We followed the new event time schema to annotate the occuring time of all the events in the TBAQ and TE3-Test data. We gradually annotated TBET (re-annotation), AQ, TE3-Test, and TB (exluding TBET) to repeatedly revise our annotation guideline to achieve good Inter-Annotator-Agreements.

> TBAQ (TimeBank:183 docs, AQ: 73 docs) and TE3-Test (20 docs for testing) were released by TempEval-2013 for addressing temporal information extraction tasks. All the TimeBank, AQ and TE3-Test were annotated by following the TimeML specification.
